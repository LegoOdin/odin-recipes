# odin-recipes

The project is to create a recipe website in the HTML I have learnt so far from the Odin Project.

This project will demonstrate the following I have learnt from the Basic HTML section of the Odin Project:
- The use of GitHub
- Project file structure and naming conventions
- HTML boilerplate
- HTML Tags (headings, paragrapghs, ordered lists, unordered lists, images, realative links, and absolute links)
